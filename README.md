## Design Decisions

### Frontend (Angular)

- Standalone Components: Adopted Angularâ€™s modern standalone API for simpler structure and better modularity.

- Component Structure: Separated into features (e.g., product-list, product-detail, create-product) inside products/pages, following Angular style guide.

- Routing: Used provideRouter() with standalone routing approach.

- Filters & Search: Implemented client-side filtering by unitCost, totalSales and search by name, without third-party state management.

- Reusable UI: Split filters and table views for better readability and possible reuse.

- Responsive UI: TailwindCSS was used for layout and responsive design, enabling smooth desktop/mobile adaptation.

### Backend (Node.js + LowDB)

- Minimal Express Server: Used express.Router() to define RESTful endpoints for GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations.

- LowDB: Chosen for simplicity and persistence during development. It auto-generates IDs and stores all products in a db.json file.

- Data Types: Ensured consistent ID types (converted to number) for sorting and filtering operations on the frontend.

- CORS: Enabled manually to support requests from localhost:4200.
