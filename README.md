# Product Catalog Dashboard

This is a full-stack web application built with **Angular 20+** and **Node.js + LowDB**.  
The app allows users to view, search, filter, sort, and manage a catalog of products.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular 20 (Standalone API), TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + LowDB (lightweight JSON database)
- **Mock Data**: Stored in `db.json`
- **Unit Testing**: Karma + Jasmine

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-dashboard.git
cd product-dashboard
```

### 2. Install dependencies

#### For frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### For backend
```bash
cd ../backend
npm install
```

### 3. Run the backend

```bash
cd backend
node index.js
```
#### Runs on http://localhost:3000

### 4. Run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
#### Opens on http://localhost:4200

## Design Decisions

### Frontend (Angular)

- Standalone Components: Adopted Angularâ€™s modern standalone API for simpler structure and better modularity.

- Component Structure: Separated into features (e.g., product-list, product-detail, create-product) inside products/pages, following Angular style guide.

- Routing: Used provideRouter() with standalone routing approach.

- Filters & Search: Implemented client-side filtering by unitCost, totalSales and search by name, without third-party state management.

- Reusable UI: Split filters and table views for better readability and possible reuse.

- Responsive UI: TailwindCSS was used for layout and responsive design, enabling smooth desktop/mobile adaptation.

### Backend (Node.js + LowDB)

- Minimal Express Server: Used express.Router() to define RESTful endpoints for GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations.

- LowDB: Chosen for simplicity and persistence during development. It auto-generates IDs and stores all products in a db.json file.

- Data Types: Ensured consistent ID types (converted to number) for sorting and filtering operations on the frontend.

- CORS: Enabled manually to support requests from localhost:4200.

## Potential Improvements

Here are some ideas to improve and extend the application in terms of functionality and architecture:

### Reusable Components
- Generic filters: Create a base abstract filter component (AbstractFilterComponent) that can be extended for specific filters (e.g., for products, sales, users).
- Reusable search bar: Extract the search input logic into a configurable standalone component using @Input.
- Table component: Modularize the product table to render dynamic columns and enable reuse across different entities.

### Data Visualization
- Comparison chart: Add a chart (e.g., using Chart.js or ngx-charts) to compare totalSales, unitCost, or both across products.
- Quick stats: Display KPIs such as total number of products, average unit cost, top 5 best-selling products, etc.

### Advanced Features
- Global search: Expand search capabilities to include description or even id.
- Backend-driven pagination: Currently, pagination is fully client-side. For better performance with large datasets, it should be handled server-side (?page=1&pageSize=10).

### Backend & Architecture
- Upgrade database: Replace LowDB with a real database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite) for improved scalability and reliability.
- Backend validation: Add schema validation for incoming data in POST and PATCH routes.
- Authentication: Add a basic login system to restrict access to product creation or editing.

### Testing & Code Quality
- Broader test coverage: Include integration tests and more thorough component/unit testing.
- Linting & formatting tools: Integrate ESLint + Prettier to ensure code consistency across the project.
